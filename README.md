# dotfiles

All my dotfiles :)

## Installing

Designed to be installable with stow:

```
stow */
```

## Nvim

This is essentially a fork of [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/), with emphasis on tooling for typescript as most of my current projects are in it.

Special thanks to [ecosse3](https://github.com/ecosse3/nvim/blob/master/lua/lsp/utils/documentcolors.lua), whose logic I stole to highlight tailwind colors.
